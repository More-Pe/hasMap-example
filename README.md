# ☎️ Simple Contact Agenda in Java

This is a basic command-line application that works like a mini contact agenda, built using `HashMap` in Java.

It lets you:

- 📝 Add contacts
- 🔍 Search for a contact by name
- ❌ Delete contacts
- 📋 View all contacts

## 💻 How It Works

The app uses a `HashMap<String, String>` where:

- The **key** is the contact’s **name**.
- The **value** is the contact’s **phone number**.

The menu allows you to interact with the app in real-time using a `Scanner`.
